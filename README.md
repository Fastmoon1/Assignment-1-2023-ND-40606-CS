Here's a detailed explanation of the difference between research method and methodology:

Research Method
1. *Definition*: A research method is a specific technique or procedure used to collect and analyze data.
2. *Focus*: Research methods focus on the "how" of data collection and analysis.
3. *Examples*: Surveys, interviews, experiments, content analysis, case studies, and statistical analysis.
4. *Purpose*: Research methods aim to collect and analyze data to answer research questions or test hypotheses.

Research Methodology
1. *Definition*: Research methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the research methods used to collect and analyze data.
2. *Focus*: Research methodology focuses on the "why" and "what" of the research approach.
3. *Examples*: Qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, ethnographic, phenomenological, and grounded theory methodologies.
4. *Purpose*: Research methodology provides a theoretical framework and justification for the research approach and methods used.

Key differences:

1. *Specificity*: Research methods are specific techniques, while methodology is a broader framework.
2. *Focus*: Research methods focus on data collection and analysis, while methodology focuses on the overall research approach.
3. *Level of abstraction*: Research methods are concrete and practical, while methodology is abstract and theoretical.

To illustrate the difference:

- "I'm using surveys as my research method to collect data on customer satisfaction."
- "I'm using a quantitative methodology to investigate the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty."

In this example, the survey is the research method, while the quantitative methodology provides the overarching framework for the research approach.
