Here's a detailed explanation of the difference between research method and methodology:

Research Method

Definition: A research method is a specific technique or procedure used to collect and analyze data.
Focus: Research methods focus on the "how" of data collection and analysis.
Examples: Surveys, interviews, experiments, content analysis, case studies, and statistical analysis.
Purpose: Research methods aim to collect and analyze data to answer research questions or test hypotheses.
Research Methodology

Definition: Research methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the research methods used to collect and analyze data.
Focus: Research methodology focuses on the "why" and "what" of the research approach.
Examples: Qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, ethnographic, phenomenological, and grounded theory methodologies.
Purpose: Research methodology provides a theoretical framework and justification for the research approach and methods used.
Key differences:

Specificity: Research methods are specific techniques, while methodology is a broader framework.
Focus: Research methods focus on data collection and analysis, while methodology focuses on the overall research approach.
Level of abstraction: Research methods are concrete and practical, while methodology is abstract and theoretical.
